php-validation
==============

my first crack at learning PHP back in 2007

Coming from a Java background I decided to learn PHP at some point. So, pick something you know and run with it in a different language. This is my first attempt at PHP Validation for a server that we could not access nor add things like php-xml so I had to do a couple of work arounds... :(

7 years later I am revisiting my code and thinking "wow - this needs some serious commenting..." but in the meantime I will simply add it to my git hub with a huge TODO (comment this!)
